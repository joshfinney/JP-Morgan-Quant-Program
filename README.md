## üåê Overview

The JPMorgan Chase & Co Forage Programme amalgamates computational mathematics, statistics, and computer science methodologies to address financial data challenges. This repository encompasses:

1. **Loan Default Prediction** (`loan_default_predictor.py`): Utilises machine learning for loan default predictions, integrating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and RandomForestClassifier.
2. **FICO Score Quantisation** (`fico_quantization.py`): Implements KMeans clustering for FICO score categorisation, enhanced by log-likelihood optimisation and illustrative visualisations.
3. **Dynamic Pricing Modelling** (`pricing_model.py`): A sophisticated pricing model accounting for transactional and storage costs, enriched by dynamic gas pricing strategies.
4. **Gas Price Estimation** (`gas_price_estimator.py`): Forecasts natural gas prices using time-series data via linear regression, complemented by an interactive interface for on-the-fly estimations.

Collectively, these modules provide a robust toolkit, addressing the multifarious challenges inherent in modern finance.

## üîç Prerequisites

To run the modules effectively, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

These can be installed using pip: 
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```
